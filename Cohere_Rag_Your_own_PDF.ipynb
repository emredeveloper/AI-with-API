That’s not a \\nworld I’d consider a win.\\nSo how can we navigate away from this dark-gray vision of the \\nfuture in ways that allow us to productively reap AI’s amplifica-\\ntion of human ingenuity while also preserving our self-determi -\\nnation and free will?\\nThe paradox of the AI era is this: as today’s imperfect LLMs \\nimprove, requiring less and less from us, we will need to \\ndemand more from ourselves . We must always insist on situ-\\nating GPT-4 and its successors as our collaborative partners, \\nnot our replacements. We must continue to figure out how to \\nkeep human creativity, human judgment, and human values at \\nthe center of the processes we devise to work with these new AI \\ntools, even as they themselves grow more and more capable.',\n",
